# Stripe Payment Integration - Complete! ✅

## 🎉 What's Been Set Up

Your Holiday Family Portrait booking page now accepts real payments through Stripe!

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`.env.local`** - Contains your Stripe API keys (NEVER commit this to Git)
2. **`src/app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts`** - API endpoint that creates Stripe checkout sessions
3. **`src/lib/stripe.ts`** - Stripe client initialization
4. **`src/app/page.tsx`** - Updated with Stripe checkout integration
5. **`src/app/success/page.tsx`** - Success page shown after payment

## 💳 How It Works

1. Customer selects a date and time
2. Clicks "Book Now"
3. → Redirected to Stripe's secure checkout page
4. Enters payment info and pays $20 deposit
5. → Redirected back to your success page
6. Booking confirmed!

## 🧪 Testing Your Integration

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You're Using LIVE Keys!

Your site is currently configured with **LIVE** Stripe keys, which means:
- Real payments will be processed
- Real money will be transferred
- Real charges will appear on customers' credit cards

### To Test Without Real Money:

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API keys
2. Switch to "Test mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Copy your TEST keys:
   - `pk_test_...` (publishable)
   - `sk_test_...` (secret)
4. Replace the keys in `.env.local`
5. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`

### Test Cards (in Test Mode):

```
Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002
Requires authentication: 4000 0025 0000 3155

Use any future expiry date (e.g., 12/25)
Use any 3-digit CVC (e.g., 123)
Use any ZIP code (e.g., 94110)
```
