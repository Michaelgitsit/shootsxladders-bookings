# Email Setup Instructions

Your booking system now sends beautiful confirmation emails automatically! Here's how to set it up:

## 1. Create a Resend Account

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (100 emails/day free)
3. Verify your email address

## 2. Add Your Domain

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Add `shootsxladders.com`
4. Follow the DNS verification steps:
   - Add the provided DNS records to your domain (same place you set up the CNAME for buy.shootsxladders.com)
   - This allows emails to come from `bookings@shootsxladders.com`

**Note:** While waiting for domain verification, you can use Resend's test domain to send test emails to your own email.

## 3. Get Your API Key

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Give it a name like "Production"
4. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

## 4. Add API Key to Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project: [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com)
2. Select your `shootsxladders-bookings` project
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
4. Add a new variable:
   - **Key:** `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** Paste your Resend API key (the one starting with `re_`)
   - **Environments:** Check all three (Production, Preview, Development)
5. Click **Save**

## 5. Redeploy

After adding the environment variable:
1. Go to your project's **Deployments** tab
2. Click the three dots on the latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**
4. Or just push a new commit to GitHub (it will auto-deploy)

## 6. Test It!

Make a test booking at [buy.shootsxladders.com](https://buy.shootsxladders.com) and you should receive:

âœ… A beautiful confirmation email with:

2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose your local webhook endpoint
