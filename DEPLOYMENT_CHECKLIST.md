```

### Security
- Never commit `.env.local` to Git
- Use test keys during development

- ‚úÖ Service descriptions (Corporate & Holiday sessions)
- ‚úÖ About section
- ‚úÖ Contact form (sends emails via Resend)
- ‚úÖ Success page for bookings
- ‚úÖ API routes for contact and checkout

Note: The page.tsx references a "Book a Holiday Session" button that links to `buy.shootsxladders.com`, but doesn't currently have the full booking calendar/payment flow implemented on the main page.
