# 🎉 Your Site is Ready to Deploy!

## What Was Fixed

Your `buy.shootsxladders.com` site had several missing pieces that prevented it from working. Here's what I fixed:

### ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Image Paths** - Moved all images from `/public/` to `/public/images/` to match your code references
2. **Missing Contact API** - Created `/api/contact/route.ts` to handle contact form submissions
3. **Missing Checkout API** - Created `/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts` for Stripe payments
4. **Missing Success Page** - Created `/success/page.tsx` for post-booking confirmation
5. **Build Errors** - Fixed Stripe API version compatibility and Suspense boundary issues
6. **TypeScript Errors** - Resolved all linting and type errors

### ✅ Build Status

Your site now builds successfully with zero errors! ✨
